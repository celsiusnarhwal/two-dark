# Two Dark

Two Dark is an adaptation of Atom's [One Dark](https://github.com/atom/one-dark-syntax) theme
for [iTerm2](https://iterm2.com). Though adaptations of this theme for
iTerm2 [already](https://github.com/one-dark/iterm-one-dark-theme) [exist](https://github.com/chinhsuanwu/one-dark-pro-iterm), the colors in this one have been adjusted to match my personal preferences â€”
specifically, to match the colors used
in [this adaptation of One Dark for JetBrains IDEs](https://github.com/one-dark/jetbrains-one-dark-theme).
